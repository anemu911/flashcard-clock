# flashcard-clock
This Chrome extension allows users to add new word and its translated word from https://translate.google.com and naver.com (mainly for Korean). The word and its translated version will then be added to your Flashcard collection. While you browse internet, a random word from the collection will show to you to help you remember the word better.
